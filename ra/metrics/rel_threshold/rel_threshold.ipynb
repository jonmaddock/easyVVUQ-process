    "# Solution requirement violation severity value as a threshold\n",
    "\n",
    "Process produces solutions with non-zero requirement violation severity $s$, i.e. some inequality constraints are violated at a converged solution. This is possibly due to tolerances on the contraint violations, and is a problem for reliability analysis as it means that the initial solution has $s > 0$, i.e. it is not feasible. This could be fixed by modifying Process to only converge when the inequality constraints are truly satisfied and $s = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in the meantime, a workaroud might be to work out the RMS constraints at the solution point, then use this as a threshold for reliability in reliability analyses: are the sample points more or less severely violated than the original solution?\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, severity:\n",
    "$$s = \\sqrt{\\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{i=1}^{N}c_i^2},$$\n",
    "i.e. the RMS of violated inequality constraints. $s > 0$ at the solution point. Therefore the solution is infeasible, and a reliability analysis around that point is likely to give a reliability $R = 0$, where $R = F_s(0 \\mid \\theta)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore use the solution severity $s$ as a threshold severity, which can be subtracted from sample severities to normalise them. The solution severity $s$ is calculated below."
