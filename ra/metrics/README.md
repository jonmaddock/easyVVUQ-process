# Local reliability analysis: different reliability metrics

Run a local reliability analysis, comparing different reliability metrics.

Originally, the requirement violation severity function $s$ was defined by the RMS violated inequality constraints. This is modified to a normalised version; normalised to the value of the severity at the solution point. The severity function then becomes a test of whether the sample point is more or less violated than the solution point.
