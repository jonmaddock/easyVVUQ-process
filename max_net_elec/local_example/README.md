# Infeasibility UQ: local evaluation example

Infeasibility UQ analysis that can be run locally, e.g. on a laptop, by using few uncertain parameters. The evaluation notebook performs the sample evaluations (intensive), whilst the analysis notebook plots the results from the generated database (non-intensive). Reponses include the individual violated constraint residuals as well as the RMS violated constraints.
