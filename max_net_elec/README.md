# Screened

Evaluate and analyse screened parameters on HPC. The evaluation (computationally intensive) and analysis (non-intensive) notebooks are separate to allow independent usage.

# Screening

Currently only the single parameter method is used, which varies uncertain parameters one at a time and ranks them in order of influence on the RMS violated constraints. This is a very inexpensive, but naive, method, which can be run locally to find the influential parameters for subsequent local or HPC studies.
